This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(lubridate)
library(stringr)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)

setwd("/Users/sss000x/Documents/Cursos/Ciencia\ de\ Datos\ 2/data-analyst_R/alumnos/sinue/Proyecto\ Sinue\ Ecobici")
df_ecobici_01 <- read_csv("dataEcobici/2018-01.csv",col_names = T, na = c(""," ", "NA", "?"))
df_ecobici_02 <- read_csv("dataEcobici/2018-02.csv",col_names = T, na = c(""," ", "NA", "?"))
df_ecobici_03 <- read_csv("dataEcobici/2018-03.csv",col_names = T, na = c(""," ", "NA", "?"))
df_ecobici_04 <- read_csv("dataEcobici/2018-04.csv",col_names = T, na = c(""," ", "NA", "?"))
df_ecobici_05 <- read_csv("dataEcobici/2018-05.csv",col_names = T, na = c(""," ", "NA", "?"))
df_ecobici_06 <- read_csv("dataEcobici/2018-06.csv",col_names = T, na = c(""," ", "NA", "?"))
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
